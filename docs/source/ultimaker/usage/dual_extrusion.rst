This comprehensive guide will walk you through the exciting world of dual extrusion, allowing you to print with multiple materials or colors in a single print job. Master the art of dual extrusion and unlock new possibilities for your 3D prints.

Preparing for Dual Extrusion
----------------------------

Before diving into dual extrusion printing, ensure you are well-prepared with the following steps:

1. **Compatible Materials:** Identify compatible materials for dual extrusion. Ultimaker 3 Extended supports a wide range of materials suitable for dual printing, such as:

   - PLA (Polylactic Acid): Easy to print, biodegradable, and available in various colors.
   - ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene): Durable and heat-resistant, ideal for functional parts.
   - Nylon: Strong and flexible, suitable for mechanical components.
   - PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol): Water-soluble support material, perfect for intricate designs.
   - TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane): Flexible and elastic, great for wearables and soft parts.
   - PP (Polypropylene): Chemical-resistant and food-safe material for containers and prototypes.
   - PC (Polycarbonate): Exceptionally strong and heat-resistant, suitable for engineering parts.

2. **Print Core Selection:** Install print cores suitable for your desired materials. Ultimaker offers a variety of print cores, including:

   - **AA Print Core (0.4mm):** Ideal for printing build materials, like PLA, ABS, and Nylon.
   - **BB Print Core (0.4mm):** Specifically designed for printing PVA support material.
   - **CC Print Core (0.6mm):** Provides increased material deposition for faster prints with build materials.
   - **AA 0.25 Print Core (0.25mm):** Offers higher precision for detailed prints.

3. **Ultimaker Cura Setup:** Configure Ultimaker Cura to enable dual extrusion. Set up material profiles for each print core, and specify the desired extruder for each model part.

4. **Model Preparation:** Design or download 3D models specifically prepared for dual extrusion. Ensure the model's design accounts for multiple materials or colors.

Multi-Material Prints
----------------------

Create stunning multi-material prints with dual extrusion using Ultimaker Cura:

1. **Material Assignments:** Assign different materials to distinct model parts using the "Per Model Settings" feature in Ultimaker Cura.

2. **Combining Materials:** Combine materials with contrasting properties, like PLA for solid parts and PVA for water-soluble support structures.

3. **Gradient Blending:** Experiment with gradient blending techniques to smoothly transition between materials for artistic effects.

4. **Model Separation:** Separate models into individual parts based on material requirements for optimal print quality.

Multi-Color Prints
-------------------

Print vibrant and colorful models with dual extrusion using Ultimaker Cura:

1. **Color Assignments:** Assign different colors to model parts using the "Per Model Settings" feature in Ultimaker Cura.

2. **Palette Swaps:** Create striking models with multiple colors by utilizing palette swaps at specific layer heights.

3. **Custom Color Profiles:** Design custom color profiles for specific filament brands or colors to achieve precise color reproduction.

Advanced Dual Extrusion Techniques
------------------------------------

Take your dual extrusion skills to the next level with advanced techniques:

1. **Prime Tower:** Minimize color contamination by enabling the prime tower to purge nozzles between dual extrusion switches.

2. **Ooze Shield:** Use an ooze shield to catch oozing material during dual extrusion, ensuring clean prints and preventing color mixing.

3. **Printing with Dissolvable Support:** Print complex models with intricate support structures using PVA as a water-soluble support material.

4. **Custom Dual Extrusion G-Code:** For advanced users, customize G-code commands to fine-tune dual extrusion behavior.

Troubleshooting Dual Extrusion
--------------------------------

Encountering challenges during dual extrusion printing? Refer to these troubleshooting tips:

1. **Under-Extrusion:** Inspect and clean print cores to address under-extrusion issues during dual printing.

2. **Material Compatibility:** Ensure compatible materials are used to prevent clogs or jams in the print cores.

3. **Layer Bonding:** Optimize print temperature and cooling settings to improve layer bonding between different materials.

4. **Color Bleeding:** Fine-tune retraction settings and ooze control to prevent color bleeding between different filament switches.

Post-Processing Dual Extrusion Prints
----------------------------------------

Post-process your dual extrusion prints for the best results:

1. **Support Removal:** Carefully remove support structures, especially when using dissolvable support materials like PVA.

2. **Sanding and Finishing:** Sand and finish the model's surface to achieve a smooth and consistent appearance.

3. **Assembly Techniques:** Assemble printed parts together using adhesives or mechanical connections for functional or multi-part models.

Congratulations! You are now equipped with the knowledge and skills to create stunning dual extrusion prints with your Ultimaker 3 Extended. Explore the endless possibilities of combining materials and colors for your 3D prints.

Happy Dual Extrusion Printing! üñ®Ô∏èüåàüéâ
