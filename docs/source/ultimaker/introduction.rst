Ultimaker 3 Extended Overview ðŸŽ‰
==============================

The Ultimaker 3 Extended is a dual extrusion 3D printer designed for professional-grade applications and extended printing capabilities. This document provides a technical introduction to the printer, outlining its major components, functionalities, and specifications.

Components and Functionalities
--------------------------------

1. **Dual Extrusion System:** The Ultimaker 3 Extended is equipped with two swappable "Print Cores". These are essentially hot ends that have been optimized for different materialsâ€”allowing for multi-material or multi-color 3D printing.

2. **Heated Build Plate:** The device includes a heated build plate with active leveling. The active leveling system probes the build plate at multiple points and adjusts the Z-offset accordingly, ensuring optimal adhesion and print quality.

3. **Wifi and Ethernet Connectivity:** The Ultimaker 3 Extended offers both WiFi and Ethernet connectivity options. This feature allows for remote printer management, including sending print jobs, monitoring print progress, and adjusting printer settings remotely.

4. **On-board Camera:** The built-in camera enables remote print monitoring.

5. **NFC Material Recognition:** The Ultimaker 3 Extended has a built-in NFC scanner that automatically recognizes Ultimaker's proprietary filament spools and adjusts settings accordingly.

6. **LED Status Indicators:** LED lights in the frame provide visual feedback about the printer's status.
