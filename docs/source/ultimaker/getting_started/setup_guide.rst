=======================

Welcome to the Ultimaker 3 Extended Setup Guide! This guide will help you verify the configuration of your Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer and ensure it's ready for high-quality 3D printing.

Step 1: Check Printer Configuration
-----------------------------------
Before diving into 3D printing, let's ensure that your Ultimaker 3 Extended is correctly configured:

1. **Build Plate Leveling:** Confirm that the build plate is correctly leveled. Use the "Level build plate" option under "Settings" to re-calibrate if necessary.

2. **Filament Loading:** Ensure that the filament is loaded into both print cores. Navigate to "Material" and verify that the correct filament types are selected.

3. **Network Connectivity:** Check if the printer is connected to your Wi-Fi network. Go to "Settings" > "Network" to verify the connection.

4. **Firmware Updates:** Confirm that your printer's firmware is up-to-date. Navigate to "Maintenance" > "Update firmware" to check for any available updates.

Step 2: Perform Test Prints
---------------------------
To ensure your Ultimaker 3 Extended is functioning optimally, consider running a few test prints:

1. **Ultimaker Test Prints:** The printer comes with pre-installed test prints. Select "Print" and choose one of the test models to check the printer's performance.

2. **Calibration Prints:** Calibration prints can help fine-tune settings and ensure accurate printing. Look for calibration models suitable for your needs.

Step 3: Optimize Print Settings
-------------------------------
To achieve the best print results, consider the following:

1. **Layer Height:** Adjust the layer height based on your desired print quality. Lower layer height provides finer details but increases print time.

2. **Print Speed:** Modify the print speed depending on the complexity and requirements of your models.

3. **Supports and Infill:** For complex designs, enable supports and adjust infill percentage to achieve desired strength and stability.

Step 4: Explore Advanced Features
----------------------------------
Unlock the full potential of your Ultimaker 3 Extended by exploring its advanced features:

1. **Dual Extrusion:** Experiment with dual extrusion to create multi-material and multi-color prints.

2. **Cura Software:** Download and use Cura software to prepare your 3D models for printing.

3. **Remote Printing:** Make use of remote printing capabilities through the Ultimaker app to start, pause, and monitor prints from anywhere.

Step 5: Troubleshooting and Support
