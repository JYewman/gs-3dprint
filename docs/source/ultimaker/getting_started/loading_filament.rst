Welcome to the Ultimaker 3 Extended Loading Filament Guide! 🚀 This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of loading filament into your Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer, ensuring smooth and reliable printing.

Before you begin, ensure that your printer is powered on, the print cores are installed, and the Ultimaker 3 Extended is ready for operation.

Step 1: Prepare the Filament
----------------------------
Start by preparing the filament you wish to load into the printer. Follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Right Filament:** Select the appropriate filament type for your printing project. Ultimaker 3 Extended supports various materials, such as PLA, ABS, Nylon, PVA, and TPU, each with unique properties.

2. **Cut the Filament End:** Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the filament end at a 45-degree angle. This will ensure a smooth insertion into the print head.

3. **Unload Filament (If Necessary):** If the printer currently has filament loaded and you want to switch to a different material or color, use the "Material" menu to unload the existing filament.

Step 2: Access the Print Core
------------------------------
To load filament into the Ultimaker 3 Extended, you'll need to access the print core. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Print Core Menu:** On the printer's touchscreen, select "Material" > "Print core 1" or "Print core 2" (depending on which core you want to load).

2. **Preheat the Print Core:** Choose the appropriate preheat option based on the filament you're using:

   - PLA: Preheat PLA (210°C for Print Core AA, 180°C for Print Core BB)
   - ABS: Preheat ABS (250°C for Print Core AA, 230°C for Print Core BB)
   - Nylon: Preheat Nylon (250°C for Print Core AA)
   - PVA: Preheat PVA (215°C for Print Core AA, 215°C for Print Core BB)
   - TPU: Preheat TPU (230°C for Print Core AA, 230°C for Print Core BB)

   The printer will reach the optimal temperature for filament loading.

Step 3: Load the Filament
--------------------------
Now, let's load the filament into the print core:

1. **Insert Filament into Print Core:** Gently insert the filament into the print core's feeder at the top. When you feel resistance, continue pushing until the filament reaches the nozzle.

2. **Confirm Filament Extrusion:** Once the filament is inserted, you should observe filament extruding from the nozzle. This indicates successful loading.

3. **Perform Material Loading Procedure:** The Ultimaker 3 Extended will automatically perform a material loading procedure to ensure proper flow and eliminate any air bubbles.

4. **Repeat for Second Print Core (If Applicable):** If you have a second print core installed, repeat the same process for the other core by selecting "Print core 1" or "Print core 2" in the "Material" menu.

Step 4: Verify Loading
-----------------------
To ensure the filament is correctly loaded and ready for printing:

1. **Check Material Status:** In the "Material" menu, verify that the loaded filament type is displayed correctly.

2. **Examine Filament Movement:** When you start a print, observe the filament movement to ensure smooth extrusion and continuous feeding.

Step 5: Start Printing
-----------------------
Congratulations! Your Ultimaker 3 Extended is now ready to create amazing 3D prints with the loaded filament.

Remember to adjust print settings and optimize your designs using Cura software for the best results.

Happy Printing! 🖨️🎉
