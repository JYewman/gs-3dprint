This guide offers detailed instructions on changing, removing, and loading filaments in an Ultimaker 3 Extended 3D printer.

.. note::

   Accurate filament management is essential for optimal printing results with your Ultimaker 3 Extended. This guide provides step-by-step instructions tailored to the printer’s unique control interface. 🔄

Introduction
============

Handling filament effectively is crucial for maintaining the quality of your prints with the Ultimaker 3 Extended. This guide will assist you in managing filament-related tasks accurately.

Changing Filaments
==================

1. **Heating the Print Core** 🔥
   - On the Ultimaker 3 Extended display, navigate to 'Material/PrintCore' > 'Material 1' or 'Material 2' depending on which filament you are changing.
   - Select 'Change' to heat the print core to the appropriate temperature.

2. **Removing the Current Filament** ↩️
   - Once heated, the printer will retract the filament slightly. Gently pull the filament out of the feeder.
   - Trim the filament end for smooth reinsertion later.

3. **Loading New Filament** ↪️
   - Insert the new filament into the feeder until it grips.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions. The printer will feed the filament through the Bowden tube to the print head.
   - Confirm on the display once the filament emerges from the nozzle.

Removing Filaments
==================

1. **Heating and Retracting** 🔥
   - Navigate to 'Material/PrintCore' and select the appropriate material slot.
   - Choose 'Remove', allowing the printer to heat the print core.
   - The printer automatically retracts the filament. Gently pull it free from the feeder.

2. **Storing the Filament** 📦
   - Coil the filament without kinks and secure it to prevent unwinding.
   - Store in a dry, cool place, ideally in a resealable bag to prevent moisture absorption.

Loading Filaments
=================

1. **Preparing the Filament** 🧵
   - Ensure the filament type (e.g., PLA, ABS) matches your print requirements.
   - Check the filament diameter (2.85 mm for Ultimaker 3 Extended).

2. **Loading the Filament** ↪️
   - Cut the end of the filament at a sharp angle to facilitate easier loading.
   - Navigate to 'Material/PrintCore' and select the slot you wish to load.
   - Insert the filament into the feeder, following the on-screen instructions.
   - The printer will automatically feed the filament to the nozzle. Confirm once you see the filament extruding.

Conclusion
==========

- **Effective Filament Handling** 🌟
   - Properly managing filament changes, removal, and loading on your Ultimaker 3 Extended ensures consistent printing quality and printer reliability.

Troubleshooting
===============

- **Filament Jams or Grinding** 🚫
   - If the filament is not moving smoothly, check for jams or clogs in the feeder or Bowden tube. Consult the Ultimaker 3 Extended manual for unjamming procedures.

- **Printing Issues Post-Filament Change** 📉
   - In case of poor print quality after a filament change, consider performing a print core cleaning procedure as described in the printer’s manual.
