About the Ultimaker 3 Extended
===============

The Ultimaker 3 Extended is an advanced 3D printer created by the Dutch company Ultimaker. The company, known for its high-quality, precision 3D printers, released the Ultimaker 3 Extended model in October 2016. It was designed with a focus on user accessibility, reliability, and superior quality prints. The printer stands out in the 3D printing market due to its larger-than-average build volume, dual extrusion system, network connectivity, and automatic material recognition capability, among other innovative features.

Features
========

Dual Extrusion System
---------------------
The Ultimaker 3 Extended utilizes a dual extrusion system, which allows it to print with two different materials or colors simultaneously. This technology gives it the ability to create complex prints with soluble support structures or multi-colored objects.

Large Build Volume
------------------
The 3D printer features a sizable build volume of 215 x 215 x 300 mm, making it suitable for printing larger models and designs.

Automatic Material Recognition
-------------------------------
With an NFC (Near Field Communication) scanner built into the printer, Ultimaker 3 Extended can automatically recognize the material of the filament being used, thus optimizing settings for a successful print.

Network Connectivity
--------------------
This 3D printer supports Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity, allowing users to send their print jobs wirelessly.

Advanced Active Leveling
------------------------
The Ultimaker 3 Extended has an automatic bed leveling system, ensuring a perfect first layer for every print. It measures the build plate at multiple points and adjusts the Z-height in the initial layers of the print if required.

Software and Materials
======================

The Ultimaker 3 Extended is compatible with the Ultimaker Cura software, an open-source 3D printing slicer application. It supports a broad range of materials, including but not limited to PLA, ABS, Nylon, CPE, and PVA. 

The Ultimaker 3 Extended was well received in the 3D printing community for its precision, reliability, and ease of use. Although it's positioned at a higher price point compared to some consumer-grade printers, its superior print quality and advanced features make it a popular choice among professionals and hobbyists seeking high-level 3D printing capabilities.
